## Recommendations 

### Product and Brand Recommendations

- **Computer Peripherals**: With the massive 35% of sales held by the 27IN gaming monitor, there is potential for more gaming peripherals such mice and keyboards that could fit nicely with the sale of the monitor.
- **Discontinue Products**: Looking at the Bose headphones and its weak performance there should be an investigation to see why the product performed so poorly. If there was proper funding for the headphones then PrimePicks should look to discontinue if storage costs are too high.
- **Offer Apple Iphone in bundle sales**: With all other Apple products performing well there should be an investigation to see why the Iphones are not selling as well. Offering a bundle with airpod headphones may provide a boost in sales to garner more of the product share.

### Loyalty Program

- **Keep Loyalty Program**: With the overall leap in loyalty program usage it is clear that the program is both being used and being adopted at a quick rate that benefits both parties. In 2022 loyalty members are ordering more products and also spending more per cart as well.
- **Loyalty Program Perks**: A perk that could boost both retention and sign ups for the program is providing more perks that benefit users. By signing up PrimePicks can send emails to users when products go on sale or send out exclusive coupon codes that will keep users coming back.
- **Email Marketing Revenue**: The loyalty program can help boost sales created from emails because of these perks. This can be another marketing medium that can draw in more customers to increase sales.

### Marketing

- **Marking Diversity**: The performance of direct marketing is the main driver for PrimePicks sales. An investigation should be done to see why direct marketing is beating all other means of marketing. By applying the aspects that work best with direct marketing then you can tap into other hidden markets and customers with other marketing mediums .
- **Social Media**: Social media is one of those channels that can greatly boost sales with minimal costs. Tiktok and Instagram are easy and inexpensive ways of reaching to target audiences that are interested in technology and products. As the lowest performing marketing channel it is worth taking a look into a social media campaign to draw in more customers.
